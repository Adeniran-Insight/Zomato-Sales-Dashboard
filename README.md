 - Categorize total sales by user acquisition and retention?
 - Examine total count based on customer Age?
 - implement a dynamic ranking system to identify the top performing cities?
 - Analyze the total sales by food category?


 ### Results

 The results are Summarized as follows:
 - while total revenue peaked at an impressive $987 million, there have been fluctuations over the past few years that demand attention. The highest revenue was generated in 2018, signaling a strong market presence and consumer demand. However, there was a noticeable decline in revenue in 2019, which further exacerbated in 2020.
 - Age Group Targeting: Furthermore, our data reveals that the age group 23 represents the highest customer count.
 - Targeted Category Insights: Our analysis highlights the importance of the "Von Veg" food category, which emerges as the best-selling category within your product lineup.
 - There is significant uptick in user acquisition, with a total gain of 12,000 new users. Conversely, there's been a loss of 33,000 users over the same period. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, we can tailor strategies to enhance customer retention and acquisition, ensuring sustainable growth.
 

 ### Recommendations
